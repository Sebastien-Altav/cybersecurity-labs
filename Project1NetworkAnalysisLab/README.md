# Network Traffic Analysis Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates network traffic analysis using Wireshark and Nmap in a controlled virtual lab environment.

## Lab Environment
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Windows 10 (Target)
- VirtualBox (Host-only Networking)

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- ICMP (Ping)
- Curl

## Objectives
- Capture live network traffic
- Identify Nmap SYN scan patterns
- Analyze TCP handshake behavior
- Apply protocol-based filters

## Key Findings
- Observed TCP SYN packets indicative of port scanning
- Identified ICMP echo request/reply traffic
- Analyzed TCP stream communication

## Files
- `captures/nmap_windows_capture.pcapng`
- Screenshots in `/screenshots`

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- Packet filtering
- Virtual lab configuration
- Security reconnaissance techniques
