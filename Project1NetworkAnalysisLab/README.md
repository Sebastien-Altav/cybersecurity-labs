# Network Traffic Analysis Lab / Notes

## Overview
This project demonstrates network traffic analysis using Wireshark and Nmap in a controlled virtual lab environment.

## Lab Environment
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Windows 10 (Target)
- VirtualBox (Host-only Networking)

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- ICMP (Ping)
- Curl

## Objectives
- Capture live network traffic
- Identify Nmap SYN scan patterns
- Analyze TCP handshake behavior
- Apply protocol-based filters

## Key Findings
- Observed TCP SYN packets indicative of port scanning
- Identified ICMP echo request/reply traffic
- Analyzed TCP stream communication

## Files
- `captures/nmap_windows_capture.pcapng`
- Screenshots in `/screenshots`

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- Packet filtering
- Virtual lab configuration
- Security reconnaissance techniques



Notes:

- Description: Initial ping test between Kali Linux and Windows 10 before enabling Windows firewall ICMP rules. Demonstrates asymmetric connectivity where Windows blocks inbound ICMP echo requests by default.

**kalipingwindowsping2.png**

- Description: Ping test after enabling inbound ICMP rules in Windows Defender Firewall. Shows successful bidirectional communication between Kali and Windows.

**icmppingrequestswireshark.png** and **filtericmppackets.png**

- Description: Wireshark capture filtered for ICMP traffic. Displays echo request and echo reply packets generated by the ping command between Kali Linux and Windows 10, as well as the filter for ICMP traffic.

**nmapscanfilteroutput.png**

- Description: Nmap SYN scan executed from Kali Linux targeting the Windows 10 host. Used to enumerate open and closed ports in a controlled lab environment.

- Description: Wireshark analysis of TCP traffic generated by the Nmap scan. TCP SYN packets are filtered and inspected using “Follow TCP Stream” to observe handshake behavior.
